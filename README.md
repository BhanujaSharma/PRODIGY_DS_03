Task-03:

Build a decision tree classifier to predict whether a customer will purchase a product or service based on their demographic and behavioral data. Use a dataset such as the Bank Marketing dataset from the UCI Machine Learning Repository.

In this project, we aim to build a decision tree classifier to predict whether a customer will purchase a product or service based on their demographic and behavioral data. The dataset used for this analysis is the Bank Marketing dataset from the UCI Machine Learning Repository, which can be accessed here. This dataset includes various attributes such as age, job, marital status, and contact information from customers who were contacted by a bank regarding a term deposit.

The project involves several key steps:

Data Preprocessing:
The dataset is first cleaned by handling missing values and duplicates, and converting categorical variables into numerical form using techniques like one-hot encoding and label encoding.

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):
We perform an analysis to understand the distribution of various features and their relationships with the target variable. This includes visualizing numerical and categorical data through histograms, bar charts, and box plots.

Feature Selection:
Correlation analysis is conducted to identify and remove highly correlated features to avoid multicollinearity.

Model Building:
A decision tree classifier is constructed to model the data. The decision tree is tuned by selecting appropriate parameters such as the criterion (e.g., Gini impurity or entropy), maximum depth, and minimum samples required to split an internal node.

Model Evaluation:
The performance of the decision tree model is evaluated using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and the F1 score. Confusion matrices and classification reports are generated to assess the modelâ€™s effectiveness in predicting customer purchase behavior.

Visualization: 
The decision tree is visualized to interpret the decision-making process and understand how different features influence the final prediction.

By leveraging this decision tree classifier, the project aims to provide insights into customer purchase patterns, enabling more targeted marketing strategies and improving the overall effectiveness of marketing campaigns.

Here is how the project looks on execution:
